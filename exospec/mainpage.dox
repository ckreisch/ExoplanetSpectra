## @mainpage ExoSpec
# @section intro_sec Introduction
# Exospec is a python tool for fitting your multi-wavelength transit light-curves
#It can accept an arbitrary number of wavelength channels and an arbitrary number of auxiliary
#measurements. Currently the fitting has two Gaussian Process kernel options: the kernel outlined
#in Gibson 2011 which incorporates auxiliary measurements made over the course of transit
#observation and a more general squared exponential.
#@section install_sec Installation
#ExoSpec uses numpy and matplotlib, as well as the Python packages batman, emcee, corner and george.
