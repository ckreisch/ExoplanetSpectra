Documentation can be generated by installing Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html) and running

doxygen Doxyfile

This will result in output folders latex and html being generated in the current folder.

To view the LaTeX documentation, execute 'make' from the latex folder.
The documentation will be written to refman.pdf

To view the html documentation (which is formatted in a more user friendly way),
open index.html from the html folder in your browser.
