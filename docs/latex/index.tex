Exospec is a python tool for fitting your multi-\/wavelength transit light-\/curves It can accept an arbitrary number of wavelength channels and an arbitrary number of auxiliary measurements. Currently the fitting has two Gaussian Process kernel options\+: the kernel outlined in Gibson 2011 which incorporates auxiliary measurements made over the course of transit observation and a more general squared exponential. \hypertarget{index_install_sec}{}\section{Installation}\label{index_install_sec}
Exo\+Spec uses numpy and matplotlib, as well as the Python packages batman, emcee, corner, pandas and george.
