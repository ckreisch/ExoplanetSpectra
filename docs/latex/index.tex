\hypertarget{index_intro_sec}{}\section{Introduction}\label{index_intro_sec}
Exospec is a python tool for fitting your multi-\/wavelength transit light-\/curves It can accept an arbitrary number of wavelength channels and an arbitrary number of auxiliary measurements. Currently the fitting has two Gaussian Process kernel options\+: the kernel outlined in Gibson 2011 which incorporates auxiliary measurements made over the course of transit observation and a more general squared exponential. The latest version is available at \href{https://github.com/ckreisch/ExoplanetSpectra/}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/ckreisch/\+Exoplanet\+Spectra/}.\hypertarget{index_install_sec}{}\section{Installation}\label{index_install_sec}
Dependencies\+: In addition to standard Python libraries, Exo\+Spec requires the following packages to run\+: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, virtualenv, mpi4py, emcee, george, batman-\/package, corner, and pandas. These packages are automatically installed when installing Exo\+Spec. To run tests with the setup.\+py file, the nose package is also required and installs automatically.

Runs with Python version 2.\+7.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Before installing Exo\+Spec, dependencies for george and mpi4py must be installed since these dependencies are not Python packages. You must install the following\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Eigen3\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item On linux\+: sudo apt-\/get install libeigen3-\/dev
\item On mac\+: brew install eigen
\item On Windows\+: the developers of george say they did not test george on Windows, so it may not work but you can still try. We have not tested Exo\+Spec on Windows
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Open\+M\+PI\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item On linux\+: sudo apt-\/get install openmpi-\/bin openmpi-\/common openssh-\/client openssh-\/server libopenmpi1.\+3 libopenmpi-\/dbg libopenmpi-\/dev
\item On mac\+: brew install openmpi
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Batman issues\+: If after moving to step 1 and running the setup.\+py file you receive an error from batman, you can install it from the source file instead
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Download the stable release here, and then run sudo python setup.\+py install
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item To install Exo\+Spec, download (\href{https://github.com/ckreisch/ExoplanetSpectra/}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/ckreisch/\+Exoplanet\+Spectra/}) and unpack the source file. Then run python setup.\+py install and all dependencies and packages will be built.
\item A suite of tests are included in exospec/tests/
