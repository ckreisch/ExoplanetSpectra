If the documentation has already been generated then html docs can be accessed
by opening index.html from the html folder in your browser. A PDF version can be
found in refman.pdf in the latex folder. The html version is more user friendly.

If the folders html and latex are not present, documentation can be generated by
installing Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html) and running

doxygen Doxyfile

This will result in output folders latex and html being generated in the current
folder. To produce a pdf from the LaTeX documentation, execute 'make' from the
latex folder. The documentation will be written to refman.pdf
